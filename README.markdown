OpenShift with NodeBB
=====================

Following instructions will guide you through the installation process of NodeBB in OpenShift cloud. They will also let you know how to keep NodeBB updated afterwards.

Before continuing, you should know how to open and use command line on your system. This guide does not describe how to do that.


## Prerequisites

First of all, you need an OpenShift account. Next, install `rhc` application, as described at
https://developers.openshift.com/en/managing-client-tools.html

After that, you should have working `rhc` and `git` available on your system.


## Installation

To install NodeBB, run following commands step-by-step, without omitting any of them.

### 1. Creating a new application

```sh
rhc app create nodebb nodejs-0.10
```

### 2. Adding database cartridge

NodeBB supports both Redis and MongoDB databases. It's up to you to decide which one to use.

To use Redis, run:

```sh
rhc add-cartridge http://cartreflect-claytondev.rhcloud.com/reflect?github=smarterclayton/openshift-redis-cart -a nodebb
```

To use MongoDB, run:

```sh
rhc cartridge add mongodb-2.4 -a nodebb
```

### 3. Add NodeBB repository

```sh
cd nodebb && git remote add upstream -m master https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB.git
```

### 4. Import NodeBB code to application

This will import source code of NodeBB v0.6.x. To import different version instead, go to https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB, see what version branches are available and replace "v0.6.x" with selected version name.

```sh
git pull --no-edit -s recursive -X theirs upstream v0.6.x
```

### 5. Add OpenShift-NodeBB repository

This will allow to import patches and action_hooks needed to use NodeBB on OpenShift without worrying too much about dynamic IP changes.

```sh
git remote add openshift -m master https://github.com/ahwayakchih/openshift-nodebb.git
```

### 6. Import OpenShift-NodeBB patches

```sh
git pull --no-edit -s recursive -X theirs openshift master
```

### 7. Push everything to application repository

This will push source code to OpenShift servers, deploy and start application.

```sh
git push
```

### 8. That's it!

After a while, you should be able to see something like this at the end of a long text output from previous command:

```
	.-============================================-.
	.  Setup Finished.
	.
	.  New administrator user has been created:
	.
	.    login   : 408a3ca2-1346-4056-a2d9-28cf45e63d4f
	.    password: XRi2HvfNegvxJkrqf8vaurgwbbWfMY
	.
	.  You can login at:
	.  http://nodebb-youropenshiftusername.rhcloud.com/login
	.
	.  WARNING: Be sure to change admin e-mail and
	.           password as soon as possible!
	^-============================================-^
```

Use that new admin login and password to login into your new NodeBB installation, and change them to something suitable for you.


## Updates

From now on, every time you want to update NodeBB, you can simply follow three steps.

### 1. Pull changes

Update NodeBB source code:

```sh
git pull --no-edit -s recursive -X theirs upstream v0.6.x
```

Update OpenShift-NodeBB patches:

```sh
git pull --no-edit -s recursive -X theirs openshift master
```

### 2. Push changes

```sh
git push
```

### 3. That's it!

After a while, you should be able to see something like this at the end of a long text output from previous command:

```
	.-============================================-.
	.  Setup Finished.
	.
	.  You can view your NodeBB at:
	.  http://nodebb-youropenshiftusername.rhcloud.com/
	^-============================================-^
```
